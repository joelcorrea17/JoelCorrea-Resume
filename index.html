        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a second year college student at the University of California Riverside. I have had three different jobs: college AVID tutor, cook, and chaperone for AP Readiness. All these jobs have contributed to me furthering my skills as a laborer, social skills, and analytical skills. Some skills I had before entering these positions however, have further improved and these positions also taught me new skills that have become very helpful and I know will be used daily in my future life. As a chaperone at AP Readiness I am in charge of taking attendance of the students, getting them set and ready to go on the bus and assisting with setting up the lunch area where we provide food during their lunch break. Once their sessions have ended, I would help them find their ways to the bus and head home. <br><br>

        	As a college AVID tutor, I would be a tutor for high school students. In this job I would do multiple things. I would help the teachers with whatever task they had for me. Most of the time I would help teachers complete the grading of student work ranging from essays, to project presentation, to math tests. For cetains teachers I would also be in charge of their gradebook and I would submit the studentsâ€™ grades and add new assignments. This job helped me get comfortable communicating, collaborating, and orgazning. My social skills improved because of how many new students I would have to interact with on a daily basis and change that environment every hour throughout the day. I had to learn to transition the way I express myself, interact with the students, and my energy depending on what group I was working with at the time. This job also helped me improve my collaborating skills because there are a lot of things which students would need help, so they would come up to me and ask for help, however I may not have taken that course or I would just not know the answer so I was forced to ask other tutors for help and we would work through the problems together until reaching a decision together.
<br><br>

        	My other job is being a cook at Panda Express. I am in charge of the kitchen as I was promoted from kitchen help to cook. This position gives me more responsibilities such as higher expectations for the quality of my work, cleanliness, amount of work I can complete, and I am in charge of others during my shift besides the managers. This job has improved my leadership skills as I am forced to look over others and make sure they are doing their job correctly and working diligently. This has taught me how to talk to people to encourage them to work harder. Also, I have learned how to watch the workers to analyze their strong points and weak points and organize their positions accordingly. If I misplace even one worker, it can bring many consequences as it can put everyone else behind and bring chaos, stress, and a huge mess. So I have to be very aware of all that is occurring at any time during my shift.
